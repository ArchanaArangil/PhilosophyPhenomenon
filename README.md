There is a phenomenon that if you start at any Wikipedia page, you will eventually reach the "Philosophy" page by clicking on the first link of every page! 
This program tests this theory by randomly generating 25 Wikipedia articles and following the first link until it reaches "Philosophy". The path with the most number of links visited is then printed out.
